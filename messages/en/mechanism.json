      "description": "When you stake your SOL, you receive elSOL in return. elSOL represents your staked SOL and the rights to earn staking rewards as a Liquid Staking Token (LST). The staked SOL is then distributed among high-quality validators through the elSOL stake pool, designed to achieve optimal yields. The rewards earned by these validators are added back into the pool, increasing the value of elSOL over time. This is why 1 SOL is not equal to 1 elSOL. By holding elSOL, you continue to accumulate rewards and can benefit more the longer you hold.",
